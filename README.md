# P4 - Code Generation

This is the code generation part of the project

As discussed during office hours, I'll be including output of the program in the `output/` folder, since my local dev environment compiles but does not compile with `make` on Delmar without throwing errors.

Tests are included in the `tests/` folder, and their names correspond with the output names. `p4-[test-name]-output` is the format I used to name the output screenshots. I used the test programs from P2 and P3, and some of the P2 programs threw errors as expected.

### Steps to Run (skip if on Delmar)

1. Run `make` in the directory
2. Run `./compfs [filename]` where filename is the file you want to test. It should be written according to he specified programming language BNF grammar

Thank you very much!
