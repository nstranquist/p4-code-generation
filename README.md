# P4 - Code Generation

This is the code generation part of the project

As discussed during office hours, I'll be showing you the code compilation live, since my local dev environment compiles but does not compile with `make` on Delmar without throwing errors. For P2 and P3, I attached output screenshots instead

### Steps to Run (skip if on Delmar)

1. Run `make` in the directory
2. Run `./compfs [filename]` where filename is the file you want to test. It should be written according to he specified programming language BNF grammar

Thank you very much!
